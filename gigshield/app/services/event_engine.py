"""Disruption event detection and auto-claim creation engine.

This is the heart of the parametric insurance model.  When an external event
(rainfall, AQI spike, curfew/strike) crosses a defined threshold, the event
engine automatically creates income-loss claims for every worker with an active
policy in the affected city — no manual claim filing required.

Phase 1 Triggers:
    • Rainfall > 50 mm in 24 h in worker's city
    • AQI > 300 in worker's zone
    • Curfew / strike flag for worker's city
